# FLOW-K
Final Year Physics project which investigates transport properties of devices subject to an external electromagnetic field


##Documentation

## Initialization 

First we import in the functions and packages required.

```javascript
from FLOW_K import E_field as E_field
from FLOW_K import Electrons as Electrics
```

Next we create our classes for the system and the electric field

```javascript
P =  e3.ECHO_3x3()
```
